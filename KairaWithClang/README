Kaira is as an open-source development environment for MPI (Message Passing
Interface) applications. We try to provide an unified environment for
activities for development: prototyping, programming, testing, debugging,
profiling, performance prediction and verification.

The main idea is to use visual models inspired by Coloured Petri Nets.
This model is designed to catch parallel aspects and communication inside of
the developed application. We do not want to program applications completely
in a visual way, so our models can be enriched by any sequential C++ code.
With such model, a user can generate MPI applications, run simulations
or start a state-space analysis.
